<HTML><FONT color="red">What is OSCILOS?

The open source combustion instability low-order simulator (OSCILOS) is an open source code for simulating combustion instability.
It represents a combustor as a network of connected modules.
The acoustic waves are modeled as 1-D plane waves for longitudinal combustors. 
This assumes longitudinal/cannular/can combustor geometry or an annular geometry but where only plane acoustic waves are known to be of interest.
